                I am a versatile and experienced web developer with a strong proficiency in 
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, and Flutter. My journey in the tech world
                began with foundational languages like C and C++, which have given me a robust 
                understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving skills. As the founder
                and CEO of AIcyborg, I lead a dynamic team in creating innovative solutions that blend artificial
                intelligence and web technologies to address real-world challenges.

                In addition to my technical expertise, I am also a published author. My books, "Younghard" 
                and "A Digital Revolution in a Child's Story," reflect my passion for storytelling and my commitment
                 to inspiring the next generation of tech enthusiasts.
